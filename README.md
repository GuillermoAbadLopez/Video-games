# VideoJuegos
 
In this repository we find my first two videogames programmed:
 - **3raya**: Very rudimentary bot with deterministic algorithms that never loses in "3 en raya".
 - **SpaceWar**: Did while in covid confinement for fun, and to learn the basics of interfaces and object-oriented programming.
 - **Doom**: Project to learn about ray tracing and shooters. Following: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECqUrT7IdqQ & https://github.com/StanislavPetrovV/DOOM-style-Game/tree/main, currently at min 11:25
