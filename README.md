# VideoJuegos
 
In this repository we find my first two videogames programmed:
 - 3raya: it's a very rudimentary bot with deterministic algorithms that never loses in "3 en raya".
 - SpaceWar: it's a personal project I did while in covid confinement for fun, and to learn the basics of object oriented programming.
